    "Many real-world problems involve datasets that evolve sequentially over time, such as **tracking**, **computer vision**, **speech and audio**, **financial time series** and **robotics**. In these applications, new data is arriving continously, requiring models and algorithms that can update probability distributions in a Bayesian manner. In many applications, we want to estimate a latent variable or process from noisy, convolved or non-linearly distorted observations. Since data arrives sequentially in many applications, it is desirable to estimate the hidden process on-line, in order to avoid memory storage of huge datasets and to make inferences and decisions in real time. Some typical applications include **real-time enhancement of speech and audio signals** and **medical monitoring of patient EEG/ECG signals**."

    "We will be looking at **sequential inference**. Only when the system is linear and Gaussian, or in the form of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) can we perform exact estimation, using the Kalman filter of HMM filter. WIn most applications, there are elements of non-Gaussianiy and/or non-linearity which make analytical computations impossible. Here, we need to use numerical strategies, for example linearisation techniques like the Extended Kalman Filter. We will aldo look at a class of Sequential Monte Carlo filters, known generically as particle filters, which are well-adapted to general problems in this category."
